# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `get_version` returns zingolib's `zl_` descriptor alone. The
  consumer's `zm_` half, the `ZINGO_MOBILE_DESCRIPTOR` variable and the
  `zm_description` build script are gone; a consumer computes its own
  descriptor and joins the two itself.
- The crate joins the root workspace. Its manifest names the features its old
  workspace carried (`nym` and `perspective` on zingolib, `lightwalletd-tonic`
  on zcash_client_backend, the runtime features on tokio), and its release
  profile is the root workspace's `[profile.mobile]`, which the builder ships.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** the `performance_level` field of `SyncSettings` and the
  `get_config_wallet_performance` endpoint are gone, because pepper-sync
  removed the performance level. Every wallet this crate initializes keeps a
  limit of 125,000 mapped nullifiers, the limit the `Medium` level gave it,
  and `set_config_wallet_to_test` sets the same limit.
