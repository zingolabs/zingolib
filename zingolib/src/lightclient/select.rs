//! The Server-Selection Sweep runner (ADR 0034): the impure half that emits
//! the survey and turns it into a sync indexer.
//!
//! The runner spawns a dedicated sweep proxy — its own `nym-proxy` child on
//! its own status channel, so its bootstrap never churns the session's
//! send/price-fetch transport and its Exit Node is distinct by construction.
//! It surveys the candidates through that exit, hands the results to the
//! pure [`sweep::select`], and drops the proxy, which recycles its exit: the
//! transport that learned what was surveyed carries nothing after.
