//! tests that can be run either as lib-to-node or darkside.

//! this mod tests fair weather behavior i.e. the LightClient is connected to a server that provides expected responses about the state of the blockchain.
//! there are many ways to mock the chain. for simplicity, and in order to be usable in multiple contexts, the test fixtures in this mod delegate setup and server management to a ChainConductor (anything that implements ConductChain)

//! darkside known issues:
//!   - transparent
//!   - txids

//! libtonode known issues:
//!   - mempool
