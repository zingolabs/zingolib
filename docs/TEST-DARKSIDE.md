## Running Darksidewalletd tests.

Darkside mode of Lightwalletd lets developers create a synthetic compact blockchain to test different scenarios from a simple sync to complex things like re-orgs that sway away knowingly confirmed transactions.

### Requirements
Clients running darksidewalletd tests need to run a lightwalletd client locally, because darkside mode isn't meant to be deployed anywhere and it has safeguards so that nobody deploys a lightwalletd server in darkside mode by mistake.

lightwalletd supported for these tests need to have the TreeState API. This means from commit `5d174f7feb702dc19aec5b09d8be8b3d5b17ce45` onwards.

## running lightwalletd in darkside mode
````zsh
#!/bin/zsh

./lightwalletd --log-file /dev/stdout --darkside-very-insecure  --darkside-timeout 1000 --gen-cert-very-insecure --data-dir . --no-tls-very-insecure
````

## running the tests (currently experimental)

By default the darkside tests are run as part of the integration tests `cargo nextest run`, for more explicit invocations:

cargo nextest run --package integration-tests --features darkside_tests -- darkside

# or to run a specific test
cargo nextest run --package integration-tests --features darkside_tests -- $TESTNAME --nocapture
